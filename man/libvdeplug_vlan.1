\f[V]libvdeplug_vlan\f[R] \[en] vdeplug nested module: VLAN (802.1Q)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
libvdeplug_vlan.so
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This is a libvdeplug module implementing VLANs (IEEE 802.1Q).
.PP
With this plugin VLANs are implemented in a distributed fashion.
The tagging (and untagging) of the packets is done, not by the switch,
but by the plugin (attached to the VM).
.PP
This module of libvdeplug4 can be used in any program supporting vde
like \f[V]vde_plug\f[R], \f[V]vdens\f[R], \f[V]kvm\f[R], \f[V]qemu\f[R],
\f[V]user-mode-linux\f[R] and \f[V]virtualbox\f[R].
.PP
The vde_plug_url syntax of this module is the following:
.PP
\f[V]vlan://\f[R][\f[I]untagged_vlan\f[R]][\f[V][\f[R]OPTION[\f[V]/\f[R]OPTION]\&...\f[V]]\f[R]]\f[V]{\f[R]\f[I]vde
nested url\f[R]\f[V]}\f[R]
.PP
\f[V]untagged_vlan\f[R] is the number of the VLAN to which the virtual
machine is connected in untagged mode.
The traffic on this VLAN will be seen by the VM as untagged.
If omitted the default value is 0, an invalid VLAN number meaning that
the VM is not connected to any VLAN in untagged mode.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[V]u\f[R], \f[V]untag\f[R]
Untagged traffic on the network will be seen by the VM as traffic tagged
with this tag.
The default value is 0, an invalid VLAN number meaning untagged traffic
will not
be tagged.
If we are sure that the traffic going by over the virtual link will only
be tagged,
untag argument is useless.
If untagged traffic is expected and untag is 0, _vlanshould be 0 too;
otherwise there would not be a method to tell untagged traffic from
traffic tagged for the
untagged VLAN, and errors during send or receive may occur.
.TP
\f[V]t\f[R], \f[V]tag\f[R]
A string used to specify the VLANs to which the VM is connected in
tagged mode.
The string is made up of a list of tokens separated by \[lq]:\[rq] or
\[lq].\[rq].
These tokens
can have two forms:
.TP
\f[V]\f[R]
(1) single vlan tag number meaning that the VM is connected to that VLAN
in tagged mode.
.TP
\f[V]\f[R]
(2) Two numbers separated by \[lq]-\[rq], meaning that the tagged
packets sent out by the VM with the first number as VLAN tag are
remapped on the VLAN with the second tag number and the packets received
by the VM on the VLAN with the second number are remapped on the VLAN
with the first number.
.TP
\f[V]x\f[R], \f[V]trunk\f[R]
A boolean argument to be used only if the connection uses trunking.
If used the VM will
be able to send and receive packets from VLANs not listed in the tag
string.
.TP
\f[V]q\f[R], \f[V]qinq\f[R], \f[V]ad\f[R]
Use the ethernet type 0x88A8 for the double tagging protool 802.1ad
(also known as QinQ).
.SH EXAMPLES
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
  vlan://3{tap://mytap}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The VM is connected to vlan 3 and receives only traffic from here.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
  vlan://3[untag=4/trunk/tag=10:11-12:12-11]{vde:///tmp/myswitch}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The VM is connected to vlan 3 in untagged mode and receive untagged
traffic with vlan tag 4.
The vlan also receives traffic from VLANs 10, 11 and 12.
VLANs 11 and 12 are switched.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
  vdens vlan://4{vlan://5/qinq{vxvde://234.1.2.3}}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This example uses 802.1ad: the VDE client is connected to the VLAN 4 of
the QinQ VLAN 5.
